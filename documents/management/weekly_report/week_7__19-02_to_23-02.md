*From     --- Monday, February 19th ---     to     --- Friday, February 23th ---*

### Overview of the week
This week, was the last one before handing out the project, so we managed to finish all the basic requirements, and you can see in the [list of tasks](https://algosup-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/benoit_dekeyn/ET3X56ZmAw1PpLeTLcSubvIB5y_Ylk7CU37q7dEQzBlDig?e=cXOKuN&nav=MTVfe0Q4MzdGRDRCLTJBNUItNDE3OC1CRjQ0LTk0RTE1MzhCRDAzQX0) what we succeeded in implementing in our program.
A tutorial to run the code is available in the readme.md

We didn't have time to finish implementing the clock cycles and the terminal output, but we have an assembler and an emulator which can compile and run an .asm file through a virtual processor.
