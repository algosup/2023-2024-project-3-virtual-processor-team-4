# Weekly report - day 1

*Wednesday, January 17th*

### Overview of the day

Due to the absence of our English teacher, we had our first half-day of the project (a total of 3:15) this week.

Initially, we found ourselves somewhat disoriented when reviewing the call for tender, attempting to comprehend the expectations.

In light of this confusion, our Program Manager was on the verge of drafting an email to our client. However, as we started discussing and explaining our understandings, we got progressively the shape of what the client wanted until it was clear to everybody.

Subsequently, we thought together, led by the Program Manager, about all the bases of functional specifications, trying to bring real added value to the creation of yet another assembly language.

### Accomplishments

- We get a clear idea of what we are going to develop.
- We defined the main tasks of the project, on an already prepared tasks management platform.
- We started the functional specification.

### Challenges

   - Understand the call for tender ("What this virtual processor is ?",  "How to create a new assembly language ?")
   - Express our ideas about technic and abstract concepts in English (so we used French a bit)

### Plan for Next Week

- Progress on the functional specifications, to give some clear instructions to the tech lead and the developers.
- For the dev: Begin to develop the bases of the code in C, the reading functions of the ASM file.
- Management: Build and begin to fill the KPIs dashboard and the documentation on GitHub.
- QA: Begin the test plan, and the test strategy.
- Tech Lead: Define all the conventions for the developers and begin the technical specifications.

# Weekly report - week 3

*From --- Monday, January 22th ---  to  --- Friday, January 26th ---*

### Overview of the week

During the two first days of this week, we continued to define the functional specifications of our new assembly language and began to code an interpreter from Assembly to direct emulation in a virtual processor. Then, on Wednesday, we had a meeting with the client, and we understood many things, particularly, the expectation to have on one hand a compiler from assembly to machine code, and on the other hand, an emulator and interpreter of the machine code in the virtual processor. Also, we rethought the instructions and their parameters, regarding the machine code aspect. Also, we advanced on the management, technical, and quality assurance documents.

### Accomplishments

- We made a C program to read an assembly file and get the algorithm from text.
- We worked as far as possible (waiting for the complete functional specifications) on the error handling in the compilation.
- We built the first virtual components (the registers) of the processor and the way to read/write in them.
- With these registers, we were able to code the first instructions for the emulator like basic operations and logic operands.
- We had a meeting with the client and redacted the minutes of it.
- We worked a lot on functional specifications, particularly about the syntax, the mnemonics, and the behavior of the instructions, as well as the machine code encoding of the algorithm for each instruction.
- We have the complete list of tasks and the KPI data, with 3 charts for now.
- We have the final project charter adapted from the new understanding of the client's expectations we get with the meeting.
- We specified the architecture implementation details and the coding conventions in the technical specifications and began to work on the compiler and interpreter part of the document. 
- The QA has already coded some assembly programs with our assembly to put it to the test.

### Challenges

   - The meeting with the client had a huge impact on the project: We planned to have a program a direct assembly to emulation interpreter, while now we'll have a machine code file. Consequently, the functional and the the start of the program we had too.
   - We will need a lot more time than expected.
   - We are late regarding the expectations.
   - Employees are quite discouraged by all the work to do, particularly about all the new functional specifications seeing the deadline.

### Plan for Next Week

- Functional: Progress on the functional specifications, to give some clear instructions to the tech lead and the developers.
- Developer: First, help with the functional specifications, especially the machine code part. Then as soon as the instructions are well defined, they will code these.
- Management: I will finish the charts of the KPIs, then, make the RACI and Gant chart, to finally complete the readme about how to run our project.
- QA: Continue the test plan, and the tests' strategy, and also create the bug report's template.
- Tech Lead: move forward on the technical specifications, in parallel with the functional ones.
