# Weekly report - day 1

*Wednesday, January 17th*

### Overview of the day

Due to the absence of our English teacher, we had our first half-day of the project (a total of 3:15) this week.

Initially, we found ourselves somewhat disoriented when reviewing the call for tender, attempting to comprehend the expectations.

In light of this confusion, our Program Manager was on the verge of drafting an email to our client. However, as we started discussing and explaining our understandings, we got progressively the shape of what the client wanted until it was clear to everybody.

Subsequently, we thought together, led by the Program Manager, about all the bases of functional specification, trying to bring real added value to the creation of yet another assembly language.

<hr>


### Accomplishments

- We get a clear idea of what we are going to develop.
- We defined the main tasks of the project, on an already prepared tasks management platform.
- We started the functional specification.

### Challenges

   - Understand the call for tender ("What this virtual processor is ?",  "How to create a new assembly language ?")
   - Express our ideas about technic and abstract concepts in English (so we used French a bit)

### Plan for Next Week

- Progress on the functional specification, to give some clear instructions to the tech lead and the developers.
- For the dev: Begin to develop the bases of the code in C, the reading functions of the ASM file.
- Management: Build and begin to fill the KPIs dashboard and the documentation on GitHub.
- QA: Begin the test plan, and the test strategy.
- Tech Lead: Define all the conventions for the developers and begin the technical specification.

# Weekly report - week 3

*From --- Monday, January 22th ---  to  --- Friday, January 26th ---*

### Overview of the week

During the two first days of this week, we continued to define the functional specification of our new assembly language and began to code an interpreter from Assembly to direct emulation in a virtual processor. Then, on Wednesday, we had a meeting with the client, and we understood many things, particularly the expectation to have on one hand a compiler from assembly language to machine code, and on the other hand, an emulator and interpreter of the machine code in the virtual processor. Also, we rethought the instructions and their parameters, regarding the machine code aspect. Also, we advanced on the management, technical, and quality assurance documents.

<hr>


### Accomplishments

- We made a C program to read an assembly file and get the algorithm from text.
- We worked as far as possible (waiting for the complete functional specification) on the error handling in the compilation.
- We built the first virtual components (the registers) of the processor and the way to read/write in them.
- With these registers, we were able to code the first instructions for the emulator like basic operations and logic operands.
- We had a meeting with the client and redacted the minutes of it.
- We worked a lot on functional specification, particularly about the syntax, the mnemonics, and the behavior of the instructions, as well as the machine code encoding of the algorithm for each instruction.
- We have done the complete list of tasks and the KPI data, with three charts for now.
- We have done the final project charter adapted from the new understanding of the client's expectations we get with the meeting.
- We specified the architecture implementation details and the coding conventions in the technical specification and began to work on the compiler and interpreter part of the document. 
- The QA has already coded some assembly programs with our assembly language to put it to the test.

### Challenges

   - The meeting with the client had a huge impact on the project: We planned to have a direct assembly to emulation interpreter, so now we'll pass by a machine code file. Consequently, the functional and the beginning of the code we had, will be impacted.
   - We will need a lot more time than expected.
   - We are late regarding the expectations.
   - Employees are quite discouraged by all the work to do, particularly about all the new functional specification seeing the deadline.

### Plan for Next Week

- Functional: Progress on the functional specification, to give some clear instructions to the tech lead and the developers.
- Developer: First, help with the functional specification, especially the machine code part. Then, as soon as the instructions are well defined, they will code these.
- Management: I will finish the charts of the KPIs, then make the RACI and Gant chart, to finally complete the readme about how to run our project.
- QA: Continue the test plan, the tests' strategy, and also create the bug report's template.
- Tech Lead: move forward on the technical specification, in parallel with the functional ones.

# Weekly report - week 4

*From --- Monday, January 29th ---  to  --- Friday, February 2nd ---*

### Overview of the week

During this week, we first finished the functional specification and began to code in C while continuing the documents each other like the technical or the test plan. We have almost finished the assembler program, which reads assembly files to machine code, and we are also on the documentation of the new language.

<hr>


### Accomplishments


- We finished the functional specification and worked on the assembly's documentation.
- We worked on the assembler program.
- We finished the KPI dashboard and the RACI matrix and completed the list of tasks.
- We created the bug report template and continued the test plan.
- We kept working on the technical specification.

### Plan for Next Week

Next week contains only 3h15 of the project, so we won't be able to progress a lot.

We plan to:
- finish the assembler program,
- continue the Gantt Chart,
- continue the Test Plan,
- finish the technical specification, and
- continue the documentation of the assembly language.

# Weekly report - week 5

*From --- Monday, February 5th ---  to  --- Friday, February 9th ---*
*Actually only **3h15 of project** on Monday morning*

### Overview of the week

During this short week of one half-day, we almost finished the assembler program which reads the assembly code and returns the machine code. The tech leader finished to details his specification and the program manager also continued to write the assembly documentation.

<hr>

### Accomplishments

- We finished the technical specification.
- We worked both on the reading of an assembly file and the generation of the machine code.
- We worked on the documentation of our assembly language.
- In parallel, we continued to review the documents and update the management content.

### Plan for Next Week

Next week we plan to:

- finish the assembler program,
- finish the Test Plan,
- continue the documentation of the assembly language,
- begin to decode the binary file in the v-processor,
- make the functions corresponding to the instructions, in C.

# Weekly report - week 6

*From     --- Monday, February 12th ---     to     --- Friday, February 16th ---*

### Overview of the week

This week, we got some trouble trying to finish the assembler program, especially due to a lot of absence on the part of this program's main coder.
We had to redefine some technical specifications which were undefined in the technical document about memory that was impossible to implement easily due to the huge size it would take on the emulating machine

<hr>
### Accomplishments

- We finished the test plan.

- We continued.

- We almost finished the documentation of our assembly language.

- We defined how the virtual terminal would work through the memory without interrupt.

- In parallel, we continued to review the documents and update the management content.

### challenges encountered

- Some technical specification about implementation of virtual memory were still to be defined.
- The software engineer who was working on the assembler was absent during 4h of project time.
- The exam of assembly took all the afternoon for three of us.
- The merge of the two steps of the assembler program generated a lot of unresolved conflicts.

### Plan for Next Week

Next week we plan to:

- Definitely finish the assembler program,
- Finish the documentation of the assembly language,
- continue the step of decoding the binary instructions in the v-processor,
- make the functions corresponding to the instructions, in C,
- If we have time, be able to print the content of the registers,
- Have a regular instruction's execution with a clock (but as threads are relative to each OS, it will be hard),
- If we have time, be able to write directly in the memory in the data section without any instruction.
