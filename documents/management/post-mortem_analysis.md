# Post-Mortem Analysis
### Team n°4 Project n°3 Virtual Processor

## Summary
During this project, the atmosphere was good. We were, each, satisfied with the outcome and the unfolding of this project. We faced a lot of trouble, but are still proud.
## Key achievements
-	The final product was fully working based on the client's requirements.
-	The presentation was better than what we used to make.
-	Git & GitHub organization was clear and well structured.
-	Team cohesion & energy improved a lot our motivation and efficiency.
## Challenges
-	The tasks and time management were poor as the manager was not aware of how the project would progress for each role, only managing people based on a task list for each role.
-	Some middle or low-priority tasks had been done before more important ones.
-	While some people made some choices in the structure or implementation, others were not aware of the evolution.
-	We worked too independently, leading to difficulties in the gathering of the different parts of the final code.
## Root Causes
-	Half of the team was new students, doing their roles for the first time. It implied a global lack of both experience and knowledge.
-	There was a lack of implication and attention from some team members.
-	Some important and lower technical specifications were missing, slowing down the development process.
-	The information was not shared enough among the team members.
## Lessons learned
-	Five weeks to develop a project is extremely short and time must be managed efficiently.
-	Last-minute changes should be avoided, considering the risks of breaking the project at the end.
## Conclusion
We learned a lot during this project and are glad to have had the opportunity to work on it.
We believe we delivered a good product and are happy with the result.
We will work to improve ourselves to fix our weaknesses for the future.
