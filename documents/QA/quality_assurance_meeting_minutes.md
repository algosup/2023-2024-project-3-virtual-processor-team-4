## Quality assurance meeting minutes

This quality assurance meeting was to talk about our different strategy testing and how we want to implement them.

< agile testing -------------------------- planned testing >

The first one to talk was Arthur.
For his strategy, he chooses to do an iterative test, which consists of testing all the things at the time they are pushed which allows rapid feedback and a better improvement of the tasks.
He also chooses to do usability testing which is like a correspondence with the client. This allows the team to know how the client interacts with the system and their feedback instantly.
He also thought about doing some Unit testing.
Finally, he also thought to plan some test sessions with other groups.
For the bug reports, he planned to create a database in Excel and implement a severity and priority system for them.

The second was Serena.
She doesn't have a particular testing strategy for the moment but she thought about using GitHub actions and issues.

Then Enzo talked.
He also thought about using GitHub Actions and he explained to us what it is. It's a tool that automatically tests the code pushed to allow a better correction before ending the push.
He also created a template for the test report and the test cases in a Google sheet, like this all the team members could access it and do some tests or create a report.
He also created a template for the wiki which allows his team members to create little documentation about the function in the code. It would then allow a better understanding of it for the non-software engineers.

Finally, I talk about my strategy.
Like Serena, I do not have a real testing strategy for the moment but I have planned to use GitHub as well by creating some templates and adding some labels on it.
I also started to create some test cases for the assembly language by coding little programs with about 20 to a bit less than 100 lines.

To conclude the meeting we suit to let the channel open to all potential questions and set a meeting only if the necessity of one is felt.
For the moment we can't test anything and it's too early to think about a date when the test could be interesting so no testing session have been planned.
